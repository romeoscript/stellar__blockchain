# Stellar Blockchain Implementation in Node.js

This repository offers a simple yet comprehensive blockchain model built with Node.js. It's designed to provide a foundational understanding of how blockchains operate, as well as how to integrate with the Stellar network using the Stellar SDK.

## Features

- **Genesis Block Creation**: Automatically initializes the very first block in the blockchain.
- **Chain Exploration**: View and traverse all blocks in the chain with ease.
- **Mining Simulations**: Incorporates a basic proof-of-work algorithm to simulate the mining process.
- **Stellar Asset Issuance**: Utilizes the Stellar SDK to issue custom Stellar assets.
